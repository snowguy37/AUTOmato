# AUTOmato
Personal project to automate large commercial greenhouses (landscape size bushes and trees) using numerous control inputs/outputs. The ultimate goal is to have each warehouse run independently but update each other through an SQL database (Maria).

This will largely be focused on measuring temperature, moister and nutrients in the soil. It will then automate fans, watering and potentially fertilizer (or manually alert for fertilizer). Groups of plant types will have their own desired ranges for each variable.

The next step will be to collect data on plant survival rates based on type, location and inputs collected.

This is a working draft. Stay tuned.
